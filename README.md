ðŸš€ Built a Mood Tracker That Understands Your Emotional Highs â€” Using Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm!

Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve been working on a small yet meaningful project â€” a Mood Tracker that doesnâ€™t just store your moods but analyzes your emotional trends using one of the classic algorithms in computer science: Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm.

ðŸŽ¯ What It Does:
Users log their mood daily on a scale (e.g., -2 for very bad to +2 for very good).
The tracker applies Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm to detect the longest positive mood streak or periods of improvement â€” similar to finding the "maximum subarray" in an array of integers.
It helps visualize emotional ups and downs and could be a helpful reflection tool for mental well-being.
ðŸ§  Why Kadaneâ€™s?
Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is known for finding the contiguous subarray with the largest sum â€” and I thought: why not use that to find when someone had their best emotional run? It's a small way of combining algorithmic thinking with real-world utility.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
JavaScript (Frontend logic)
HTML/CSS for UI
ðŸ’¡ Takeaway:
Sometimes, the power of algorithms lies not just in solving coding problems, but in making sense of human experiences.
